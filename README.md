# Readme Instructions:

preq-DOCUMENTATION-2

Your project's README.md file will contain the following sections:

- Introduction
- Table of Contents
- Team Members
- Architecture
- Environment
- Executing the Web Application
- Executing Unit Tests
- Reviewing Unit Test Coverage
- Executing End-To-End Tests
- Final Video Presentation
- Order your README.md file according to the section order shown above.

preq-DOCUMENTATION-3: Introduction

Your Introduction section will be titled "KSU SWE 3643 Software Testing and Quality Assurance Semester Project: Web-Based Calculator" rather than "Introduction". Set this section to an H1 (# KSU SWE...).

Following the title, write a short (2-3 sentence) description of what the repository contains.

preq-DOCUMENTATION-4: Table of Contents

Create an H2 section named Table of Contents (## Table of... ). List the sections starting with Environment as bullets.

List all of the sections in your document execept the introduction and Table of Contents. Create a hyperlink to each section. Your hyperlink will look like the following example:

## Table of Contents

- [Environment](#environment)
- [Executing the Web Application](#executing-the-web-application)
All of your links will be relative. If you find yourself writing links that include GitHub's address, you are likely not writing relative links. Clone this repository if you need an example: the relationship of README.md to requirements.md demonstrates relative linking.

To create an anchor link (a link that jumps somewhere within the current document), prefix the section's title with a # symbol, then write the title lowercase and place a dash in place of all spaces. Always test your anchor links after checking your work into GitHub to verify that they work correctly (particularly if you use Typora, which is more forgiving than GitHub)
